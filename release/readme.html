                EnergyPlus is a simulation program designed for modeling buildings with all their associated
                heating, cooling, lighting, ventilating, and other energy flows. EnergyPlus is a stand-alone simulation engine
                without a ‘user friendly’ graphical interface.  EnergyPlus reads input and writes output as text files...

    <h2>Using EnergyPlus</h2>
    <p>
        Utilities and tools for creating, editing, and running input files that come with EnergyPlus include IDF Editor
        and EP-Launch. Many graphical user interfaces for EnergyPlus are available or under development. For the latest
        tools, please see
        <a href="https://www.buildingenergysoftwaretools.com/?capabilities=Whole-building+Energy+Simulation&keywords=EnergyPlus">
            this website for third party interfaces</a>. A completely new cross-platform version of EP-Launch has been
        developed and is available separate from the EnergyPlus install; see the <a
            href="https://ep-launch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#ep-launch">documentation</a> for more
        information.  Some tools may produce out of date IDF files; you can then use the IDFVersionUpdater program to
        convert older files to current EnergyPlus version (you may need to use the Multiple Version Conversions
        set – see below).

                Is 9.4 different from 9.3? (What's up with this library stuff?)

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Put a pin in that library question for a moment.  For a majority of users, EnergyPlus is still
                        basically the same tool, but with some great new features, bug fixes, and runtime performance
                        improvements.  Running EnergyPlus can still be accomplished the same way, by creating an input
                        file in IDF or EpJSON syntax, running the EnergyPlus(.exe) binary, and gathering results of
                        interest.  All this power is still available.  &#128077; <br>
                        As of EnergyPlus 9.3, EnergyPlus started becoming a bit more flexible thanks to the addition of
                        a formal C API with Python Bindings, as well as the ability to execute user-defined Python
                        "plugins" in lieu of writing user-defined Erl code.  In the library mode, a
                        client can make function calls to setup and execute a simulation, as well as interact with
                        simulation results <b>during</b> a simulation. &#128077; &#128077; &#128077;<br>
                        With version 9.4 the library APIs heavily changed, so scripts will need to be updated. (Don't
                        worry we won't make a habit of that!).  Details of these major changes along with other
                        significant features for this version are listed below in this readme.  Also, see the full
                        <a href="https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/releases/latest" class="card-link">ChangeLog</a>

                    With every EnergyPlus release, there are new checks on user input. Even if your file ran in an
                    earlier version, it may not run in the newer version after conversion due to newer checks on the
                    validity of input.

    <h2><a id="Multiple_Version_Conversions_51"></a>Multiple Version Conversions</h2>
    <p>
        The install includes the IDFVersionUpdater program and the necessary programs to convert from the previous
        version (including .rvi and .mvi files) to the current version. The install also includes the necessary programs
        to convert from older versions back to v7.2.0.  For versions older than v7.2.0, first we applaud your dedication
        to EnergyPlus that stretches for quite some time, and second you will need to visit the
        helpdesk and download the multiple conversion set of programs. The helpdesk downloads area:
        <a href="http://energyplus.helpserve.com/Knowledgebase/List/Index/46/converting-older-version-files">
            Converting Older Files</a>
        will contain the necessary readmes and zip/tar files of programs to convert IDFs from V1.0 to
        the current version.
    </p>

    <h2><a id="Documentation_55"></a>Documentation</h2>
    <p>
        The EnergyPlus documentation is included in pdf form in the installer. The pdfs are also available <a
            href="https://energyplus.net/documentation">online</a>. For <strong>new users</strong> of EnergyPlus, a
        guide called the EnergyPlus Essentials was developed and is available with the installed pdf documentation.
        Big Ladder Software is also hosting html versions of the
        EnergyPlus Documentation <a href="http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/">online</a>.
    </p>
    <p>There are some other documents of interest available on the EnergyPlus web site including:</p>
    <div class="list-group">
        <a href="https://energyplus.net/quickstart" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">An EnergyPlus
            QuickStart Guide</a>

            Reports</a>
    </div>
    <p>
        In addition, we are working to make our API documentation dynamic and hosted on ReadTheDocs.  The
        <a href="https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/blob/develop/README.md">README</a> on our Github Repo will be kept
        up to date with links to our documentation sources as we get things settled there.
    </p>

    <h2><a id="Weather_Data_63"></a>Weather Data</h2>
    <p>A small subset of weather files that are available on the web site are also installed in the WeatherData folder.
        EnergyPlus uses these files directly for annual simulations. The Weather Converter program that is part of
        EnergyPlus can read these weather files and provide .csv (comma separated variable) as well as statistics
        reports
        about the included (or other) files. Weather data for more than 2100 locations in more than 100 countries can be
        downloaded on the <a href="https://energyplus.net/weather">EnergyPlus Weather Page</a>.</p>

    <h2>An Important Note About the API</h2>
    <p>
        Under normal circumstances, we intend on providing a very stable API for clients to access EnergyPlus.
        However, as somewhat expected (see 9.3 README), the first release of the API was always likely to expose
        some cases that would require a change in the API.  Indeed it did.  The change is pretty widespread through the
        API, but quite an easy change to make.  In summary - a new argument is needed in most functions, including
        Python Plugin method overrides and user-defined runtime API callback functions.  The client merely needs to
        accept this argument in functions and pass it back in to the API methods.  More information can be found in the
        input-output reference document.

    <p>
        Packages changed slightly with 9.4.  We are now building our packages on a new system which adds better support
        for some platforms.  During the change, we are stepping away from some older OS versions.  For example, we are
        not testing on Windows 7 or 8, only 10.  However, both our 32-bit and 64-bit packages now include the new
        Python plugin system, rather than just the 64-bit as previously.  We have also added packaging and testing
        with Ubuntu 20.04 <i>in addition to</i> Ubuntu 18.04.  On Mac, we are officially releasing an installer for
        OSX 10.15, although we will make an effort to offer a package for an older version.  (Though 10.15 has been
        out for a while now...)

    <h2><a id="Installation_contents_100"></a>Installation contents</h2>
    <p>The installation creates a program folder with icons/shortcuts for the programs/files in EnergyPlus that can be
        accessed from Windows menus, including removing EnergyPlus from your system. In Windows OS, these will be
        available from the “Programs” area in the Start Menu. Note that only a few of the programs will store anything
        in your Windows\System directory (IDFEditor, EPLaunch, WeatherConverter).</p>
    <h2><a id="Known_problems_104"></a>Known problems</h2>
    <p>While every effort has been made to clean up all the “defects” that have occurred during our testing, quite a few
        known (and even more unknown) probably remain. Specifics on the remaining known problems can be found on the
        GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/issues">issues page</a>. If you are interested in
        what has been addressed, the issues resolved in this release are installed similarly in the
        <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a>.
