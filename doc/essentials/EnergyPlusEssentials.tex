\section{Introduction}

\section*{What is BEM?}

According to the \href{https://www.bemlibrary.com/index.php/owners-managers/introduction/what-bem/}{BEM Library}:
\begin{quotation}
``Building Energy Modeling (BEM) is the practice of using computer-based
simulation software to perform a detailed analysis of a building\textquoteright s
energy use and energy-using systems. The simulation software works
by enacting a mathematical model that provides an approximate representation
of the building. 

``BEM includes whole-building simulation as well as detailed component
analysis utilizing specialized software tools that address specific
concerns, such as moisture transfer through building materials, daylighting,
indoor air quality, natural ventilation, and occupant comfort.

``BEM offers an alternative approach that encourages customized,
integrated design solutions, which offer deeper savings. Using BEM
to compare energy-efficiency options directs design decisions prior
to construction. It also guides existing building projects to optimize
operation or explore retrofit opportunities.''
\end{quotation}
Some other terms that are used to describe the same topic are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Building Simulation
\item Building Performance Simulation
\item Building Energy Simulation
\item Building Performance Modeling
\end{itemize}
Somewhat confusing, the term ``model'' can refer to both the specific
building being described and analyzed as well as referencing the software
for implementing a specific component of the building such as a wall
or chiller.

To learn more about building energy modeling consider reviewing the
following resources:
\begin{itemize}

19 Energy Estimating and Modeling Methods
\item \href{https://www.bemlibrary.com/}{BEM Libary}
\item \href{http://www.ibpsa.org/?page_id=695}{IBPSA}, \href{https://www.ibpsa.us/videos/all}{IBPSA-USA},
and \href{https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=building+energy+modeling}{YouTube}
videos
\item And numerous \href{https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias\%3Daps&field-keywords=building+energy+modeling}{books}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Questions that BEM can answer}

The most common questions that BEM can answer are:
\begin{itemize}
\item If my building was made or operated differently, how would the energy
consumption change?
\item Does my building comply with a building energy code or standard?
\item What kind of rating or how many points can I get in a environmental
certification program?
\item Is my building operating as it was designed to?
\item What is a good target for energy consumption for my building?
\end{itemize}
These questions can take place at different times during the life-cycle
of a building from before schematic design all through the rest of
the design process, and into the operation of the building

\subsection*{The Design Process and BEM }

Building energy modeling can be used throughout the design process
for a new building or when considering updates to existing buildings.
It can also be used later in the life-cycle of a building related
to comparing actual operation of the building with predicted operation.
ASHRAE \href{https://www.techstreet.com/ashrae/standards/ashrae-209-2018?gateway_code=ashrae&product_id=2010483}{Standard 209}
titled ``Energy Simulation Aided Design for Buildings Except Low-Rise
Residential Buildings'' is a critical document to in how to apply
building energy modeling. It describes a methodology to apply building
energy modeling to the design and was created to define reliable and
consistent procedures that advance the use of timely energy modeling
to quanifty the impact of design decision s at the point in time which
they are made. The standard includes different \textquotedblleft Modeling
Cycles\textquotedblright{} for different stages of using building
energy modeling during the life-cycle of the building:
\begin{itemize}
\item Modeling Cycle \#1 -- Simple Box Modeling
\item Modeling Cycle \#2 -- Conceptual Design Modeling
\item Modeling Cycle \#3 -- Load Reduction Modeling
\item Modeling Cycle \#4 -- HVAC System Selection Modeling
\item Modeling Cycle \#5 -- Design Refinement
\item Modeling Cycle \#6 -- Design Integration and Optimization
\item Modeling Cycle \#7 -- Energy Simulated-Aided Value Engineering
\item Modeling Cycle \#8 -- As-Designed Energy Performance
\item Modeling Cycle \#9 -- Change Orders
\item Modeling Cycle \#10 -- As-Built Energy Performance
\item Modeling Cycle \#11 -- Postoccupancy Energy Comparison
\end{itemize}
In addition it has information about how to integrate climate and
site analysis, benchmarking, energy charretts, the energy performance
goals of the owners project requirements in to the design process
when using buiding energy modeling.

\subsection*{EnergyPlus Capabilities}

According to the \href{https://energyplus.net/}{energyplus.net web site}
(as of December 2018):
\begin{quotation}
``EnergyPlus\texttrademark{} is a whole building energy simulation
program that engineers, architects, and researchers use to model both
energy consumption---for heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting
and plug and process loads---and water use in buildings. Some of
the notable features and capabilities of EnergyPlus include:
\end{quotation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Integrated, simultaneous solution of thermal zone conditions and HVAC
system response that does not assume that the HVAC system can meet
zone loads and can simulate un-conditioned and under-conditioned spaces.
\item Heat balance-based solution of radiant and convective effects that
produce surface temperatures thermal comfort and condensation calculations.
\item Sub-hourly, user-definable time steps for interaction between thermal
zones and the environment; with automatically varied time steps for
interactions between thermal zones and HVAC systems. These allow EnergyPlus
to model systems with fast dynamics while also trading off simulation
speed for precision.
\item Combined heat and mass transfer model that accounts for air movement
between zones.
\item Advanced fenestration models including controllable window blinds,
electrochromic glazings, and layer-by-layer heat balances that calculate
solar energy absorbed by window panes.
\item Illuminance and glare calculations for reporting visual comfort and
driving lighting controls.
\item Component-based HVAC that supports both standard and novel system
configurations.
\item A large number of built-in HVAC and lighting control strategies and
an extensible runtime scripting system for user-defined control.
\item Functional Mockup Interface import and export for co-simulation with
other engines.
\item Standard summary and detailed output reports as well as user definable
reports with selectable time-resolution from annual to sub-hourly,
all with energy source multipliers.''
\end{itemize}
EnergyPlus runs on Windows, MacOS, and Linux computers.

\subsection*{Open Source}

\href{https://energyplus.net/}{EnergyPlus}is an \href{https://opensource.org/}{Open Source}
program so all the \href{https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus}{source code}
is available to inspect and modify. If you are interested in how calculations
are performed and the \href{https://energyplus.net/documentation}{Engineering Reference}
does not provide enough details to you, you can review the source
code itself. \href{https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/wiki/BuildingEnergyPlus}{Instructions to build the code}
(compile the source code into an executable application) are available
in source code repository wiki if you see something that needs to
be enhanced or fixed. 

\subsection*{Brief History}

EnergyPlus has been under development since 1997 and was first released
in 2001. Originally written in Fortran, in 2014 it was converted to
C++.

EnergyPlus has its roots in both the BLAST and DOE--2 programs. BLAST
(Building Loads Analysis and System Thermodynamics) and DOE--2 were
both developed and released in the late 1970s and early 1980s as energy
and load simulation tools. BLAST was developed by \href{https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/Locations/CERL/}{Construction Engineering Researrch Laboratory (CERL)}
and \href{https://illinois.edu/}{University of Illinois} which DOE-2
was developed by \href{https://www.lbl.gov/}{Berkeley Lab} and many
others. Their intended audience is a design engineer or architect
that wishes to size appropriate HVAC equipment, develop retrofit studies
for life cycling cost analyses, optimize energy performance, etc.
Born out of concerns driven by the energy crisis of the early 1970s
and recognition that building energy consumption is a major component
of the American energy usage statistics, the two programs attempted
to solve the same problem from two slightly different perspectives.
Both programs had their merits and shortcomings, their supporters
and detractors, and solid user bases both nationally and internationally.
