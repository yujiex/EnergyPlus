Input Changes
=============

This file documents the structural changes on the input of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.
This was previously an Excel workbook that made for very difficult version control, especially during busy times around code freezes.

# Object Change: `Schedule:File`

The only change is for Field A4 (Column Separator). Replace "Fixed" with "Space". Field A1-A3, A5, and N1-N4 remain the same.


# Object Change: `ObjectNameB`

# Object Change: `ObjectNameC`

# Object Change: `ObjectNameD`

# Object Change: `ObjectNameE`
