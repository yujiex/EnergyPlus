Input Changes
=============

This file documents the structural changes on the input of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.
This was previously an Excel workbook that made for very difficult version control, especially during busy times around code freezes.

# Object Change: `RunPeriod`
Field A1 "Name" is now a required field. If blank, add a name. If the old idf has more than one RunPeriod object, all of the Name fields must be unique.

# Object Change: `Schedule:File`
The only change is for Field A4 (Column Separator). If A4 = "Fixed" then replace with "Space". Field A1-A3, A5, and N1-N4 remain the same.

# Object Change: `ThermalStorage:Ice:Detailed`
Fields A5 and A7 change description to Discharging Curve Variable Specifications and Charging Curve Variable Specifications, respectively.  The old options for these fields were either QuadraticLinear or CubicLinear.  

For A5 (field 6), if the field previously had QuadraticLinear, it should be changed to FractionDischargedLMTD.  If A5 was defined as CubicLinear, it should be changed to LMTDMassFlow.  

For A7 (field 7), if the field had previously been QuadraticLinear, it should now say FractionChargedLMTD.  If A7 was CubicLinear, it should be changed to LMTDMassFlow.

# Object Change: `ObjectNameB`

# Object Change: `ObjectNameC`

# Object Change: `ObjectNameD`

# Object Change: `ObjectNameE`

# Object Change: `ObjectNameF`
