Welcome to EnergyPlus Python API documentation!
===============================================

EnergyPlus now includes Python bindings that wrap a C API.
There are two primary use cases of the API:

* Calling EnergyPlus as a library, where either a compiled C program or a Python script makes use of the API by calling into the program.
* Running EnergyPlus in a traditional way, but using user-defined Python scripts to manipulate the running simulation.

A walkthrough of both of these use cases of the API is available in the EnergyPlus Input Output Reference documentation.
That may be brought into this page to keep documentation in one location.
This site provides full details of the API functions.
