## Justification for New Feature ##

As EnergyPlus approaches a convergence with next-generation Spawn tools, some aspects of EnergyPlus are expected to be retained and refactored to avoid re-developing those for the new simulation ecosystem. The global variable state in EnergyPlus is a problem to current researchers and developers, and will be a major factor in that new ecosystem. For this task, several phases can be performed to arrive at a favorable global variable state in EnergyPlus. This approach will more easily allow starting/resetting state of EnergyPlus. The current global state of EnergyPlus is already partially documented through the use of “clear_state” functions that were added throughout the EnergyPlus code to enable unit tests to execute with a fresh simulation state.
