Output Changes
==============

This file documents the structural changes on the output of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.

### Description

This will eventually become a more structured file, but currently it isn't clear what format is best. As an intermediate solution, and to allow the form to be formed organically, this plain text file is being used. Entries should be clearly delimited.  It isn't expected that there will be but maybe a couple each release at most. Entries should also include some reference back to the repo.  At least a PR number or whatever.


### New Underground Gross Wall Area Added to Zone Summary Table in Input Verification and Results Summary Report

The Zone Summary table in the Input Verification and Results Summary Report always had a column labeled "Gross Wall Area" which was the above ground wall area for each zone. This change relabeled that column to be called "Above Ground Gross Wall Area" and added an entirely new column called "Underground Gross Wall Area" that shows the amount of underground wall area for each zone.
