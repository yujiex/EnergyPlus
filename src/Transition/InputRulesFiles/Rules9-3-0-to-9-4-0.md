Input Changes
=============

This file documents the structural changes on the input of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.
This was previously an Excel workbook that made for very difficult version control, especially during busy times around code freezes.

Fields 1-14 remain the same.

Insert field 15, Fan Heat Included in Lookup Tables.
