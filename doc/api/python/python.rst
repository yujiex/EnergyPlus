EnergyPlus Python Overview
--------------------------

Although the core EnergyPlus simulation engine is written in C++, there are actually several languages and tools that go into building, packaging and running EnergyPlus.
There are FORTRAN tools that are built around the edges of EnergyPlus and have been developed to preprocess inputs prior to running EnergyPlus, or postprocess results.
There are GUI tools packaged with EnergyPlus that are built with Visual Basic and RealBasic.
In recent years, Python has been employed to handle several tasks around EnergyPlus, although until recently they have been mostly on the developer side.
With the most recent versions, Python is starting to impact packages and user experiences

Hit several points in here:

 - Building
 - Linking
 - Versioning
 - API
 - Plugins
 - Examples
