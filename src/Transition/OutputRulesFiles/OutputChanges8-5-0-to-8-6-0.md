Output Changes
==============

This file documents the structural changes on the output of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.

### Description

This will eventually become a more structured file, but currently it isn't clear what format is best. As an intermediate solution, and to allow the form to be formed organically, this plain text file is being used. Entries should be clearly delimited.  It isn't expected that there will be but maybe a couple each release at most. Entries should also include some reference back to the repo.  At least a PR number or whatever.


### New Underground Gross Wall Area Added to Zone Summary Table in Input Verification and Results Summary Report

The Zone Summary table in the Input Verification and Results Summary Report always had a column labeled "Gross Wall Area" which was the above ground wall area for each zone. This change relabeled that column to be called "Above Ground Gross Wall Area" and added an entirely new column called "Underground Gross Wall Area" that shows the amount of underground wall area for each zone.

See [5588](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/pull/5588). 


### Life-Cycle Cost Report Updated for Water

1. The "Energy Cost Cash Flows (Without Escalation)" table has been renamed "Energy and Water Cost Cash Flows (Without Escalation)". 

2. The "Operating Cash Flow by Category (Without Escalation)" table used to combine energy and water costs in the Energy column and have zeros in the Water column. Now energy costs are in the Energy column and water costs are in the Water column. 

3. The "Present Value for Recurring, Nonrecurring and Energy Costs (Before Tax)" table used to show water costs with the Energy in the Category column and Energy Cost in the Kind column but now show Water and Water Cost in those respective columns. 

4. The Present Value by Category table used to include the sum of energy and water present values in the Energy row and zero in the Water row but now the present values of energy costs and water costs are in the appropriate row. 

See [5594](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/pull/5594). 

### Degree days in tabular reports correspond to ASHRAE Standard 90.1 degree day bases

Impacts the LEED Summary report table SEc1.1A-General Information and the Climatic Data Summary report. The #5083 issue was resolved and indicated that the temperature bases used for reporting the heating and cooling degree days were not consistent with ASHRAE Standard 90.1 which uses CDD50 and HDD65 (Fahrenheit). These correspond to CDD10 and HDD18 (Celsius). Previously these were reversed and using CDD65 and HDD50 instead. In addition made changes to use the terms "standard" to be "ASHRAE Handbook 2009" for the reporting of the degree day values in the Climatic Data Summary report.

See [5572](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/pull/5572). 

### Economics, Tariff, and Life Cycle Cost Reports Explicitly Requested

The Economics Results Summary Report, Tariff Report, and Life-Cycle Cost Report now need to be specifically requested rather than being automatically generated if specific objects are present in the file. To get the reports individually use EconomicResultSummary, TariffReport, and LifeCycleCostReport respectively in the Output:Table:SummaryReports object. These are also available when using any of the AllSummary options. The reports are unchanged just they way of generating them has changed.

See [5598](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/pull/5598). 


### JtoKWH Unit Conversion Impacts LEED Summary Report

When the JtoKHW unit conversion option is used in the OutputControl:Table:Style object it now changes the units used in the LEED Summary report. Columns that were previously left as GJ are now expressed as kWh and columns that were previously MJW/m2 are now expressed as kWh/m2.

See [5616](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/pull/5616).

### New Rows for District Heating and Cooling Virtual Rate in LEED EAp2-3 Table

When district heating or cooling is used, additional rows in the LEED EAp2-3 are shown with the virtual rates for those energy sources are shown.   

See [5639](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/pull/5639).
