/// \brief This is typedef for an instance that stores the "state" of an EnergyPlus simulation.
/// \details The state of an EnergyPlus simulation is held heavily in the global program state.  To alleviate issues
///          with this design in the context of new applications and workflows, the global program state is being
///          refactored into a single variable which will ultimately own and manage the entire state of the simulation.
///          In order to keep track of the simulation during API calls, a reference to a state must be kept and
///          managed by the API client.  The client must call `stateNew` to create a new state instance, and pass this
///          to any functions that need a state instance.  Once a simulation is complete, the client can call
///          `stateReset`, which will reset the state instance passed in, along with any global variables that are not
///          yet refactored into this state instance.  Once complete, the client has the ability to free the memory of
///          the state by using the `stateDelete` function..
