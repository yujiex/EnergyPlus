! BESTEST Ground-Coupled In-Depth Case GC30b.idf
! Basic file description: Pure GC Effect of Slab-on-Grade
! Slab is 12m x 12m; Aspect Ratio=3.0
! Slab thickness, irrelevant because soil and slab have same properties
! Must first run CalcSoilSurfTemp utility to get Kusuda-Achebach inputs
! Author:   R. H. Henninger,  GARD Analytics, Inc.
! Date:     August 2015
! Run:      Annual run
! Building: Fictional 1 zone building with adiabatic walls and roof and no window.
!           No internal load, no infiltration
! Internal: None.
