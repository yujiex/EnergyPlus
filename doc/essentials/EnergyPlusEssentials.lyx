What is BEM?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to the

\begin_layout Quotation
Building Energy Modeling (BEM) is the practice of using computer-based simulatio
n software to perform a detailed analysis of a buildingâ€™s energy use and
 energy-using systems.
 The simulation software works by enacting a mathematical model that provides
 an approximate representation of the building.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
BEM includes whole-building simulation as well as detailed component analysis
 utilizing specialized software tools that address specific concerns, such
 as moisture transfer through building materials, daylighting, indoor air
 quality, natural ventilation, and occupant comfort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
BEM offers an alternative approach that encourages customized, integrated
 design solutions, which offer deeper savings.
 Using BEM to compare energy-efficiency options directs design decisions
 prior to construction.
 It also guides existing building projects to optimize operation or explore
 retrofit opportunities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some other terms that are used to describe the same topic are:

\begin_layout Itemize
Building Performance Simulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

Building Performance Modeling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Somewhat confusing, the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

model
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can refer to both the specific building being described and analyzed as
 well as referencing the software for implementing a specific component
 of the building such as a wall or chiller.

\begin_layout Section*
Questions that BEM can answer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most common questions that BEM can answer are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If my building was made or operated differently, how would the energy consumptio
n change?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Does my building comply with a building energy code or standard?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What kind of rating or how many points can I get in a environmental certificatio
n program?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Is my building operating as it was designed to?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What is a good target for energy consumption for my building?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These questions can take place at different times during the life-cycle
 of a building from before schematic design all through the rest of the
 design process, and into the operation of the building
