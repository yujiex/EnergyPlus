# set RESOLVED_PYTHON_LIB, and EXECUTABLE_PATH when calling

# when the build first completes, prior to fixing anything up, the executables have dependencies that need to be fixed up
# energyplus, the core binary
#  it has a dependency on the libenergyplusapi dynamic library, and it will be looking for it at: @rpath/libenergyplusapi.X.Y.Z.dylib
#  it will need to be changed to look for the api lib at @executable_path/libenergyplusapi.X.Y.Z.dylib
#  this is handled separately
# libenergyplusapi, the dynamic library
#  now that we have detached the python dynamic lib into a lazy load, this won't have anything to change, w00t!
# libpythonwrapper, the python wrapper/interface
#  this library was added to detach energyplus from a hard dependency on the python dylib, and e+ now instead lazy loads this interface
#  this wrapper depends on the core python dll at /some/path/to/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/{SomePythonLibName}
#  we are packing up the python lib with E+, so it just needs to look for it at @executable_path/{SomePythonLibName}
#  we also change the -id from @rpath/libpythonwrapper to @executable_path/libpythonwrapper
# Python, the actual python library
#  this is the main python dynamic library that we distribute with e+
#  we just need to change the -id from /some/path/to/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/{SomePythonLibName} to @executable_path/{SomePythonLibName}

# the paths are dynamic, so we need to build out all these change commands somewhat dynamically
# the only thing we have to go on is that we know:
#   EXECUTABLE_PATH points to the current energyplus executable, and
#   RESOLVED_PYTHON_LIB points to the Python dynamic library
